## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

Built with **Manifest V3** for modern Chrome extension standards:

```
📁 Extension Structure
├── 🎨 popup/           # User interface (HTML, CSS, JS)
├── ⚙️  background/     # Service worker for alarms & injection
├── 📄 content/         # Takeover overlay scripts & styles
├── 🔧 shared/          # Reusable modules (storage, alarms)
└── 🖼️  icons/          # Extension icons (16px, 48px, 128px)
```

### 🔄 **Workflow**

1. **📝 User Input** → Popup interface handles reminder creation/editing
2. **💾 Data Storage** → Chrome storage sync with intelligent caching
3. **⏰ Scheduling** → Chrome alarms API for energy-efficient triggers
4. **🚨 Alert Trigger** → Service worker listens for alarm events
5. **💉 Content Injection** → Programmatic script/CSS injection into all tabs
6. **🖥️ Takeover Display** → Full-screen modal with reminder details
7. **🔄 Synchronized Actions** → Cross-tab communication for dismiss/snooze
